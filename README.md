# 🛡️ 42 Cybersecurity Piscine

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Piscine** repository from 42 Beirut!  
This repo contains the key projects I completed during the intense 3-week training focused on Linux, scripting, networking, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## 📁 Projects

### 🕷️ `spider.py`

A custom Python script that performs **web scraping and directory enumeration**.

**Skills practiced:**
- Working with HTTP requests using `requests`
- Parsing HTML using `BeautifulSoup`
- Recursively crawling URLs to find hidden paths or files (like a basic web spider)
- Bypassing basic protections (robots.txt, 403 errors)


---

### 🔐 `otpkey`

A challenge focused on **OTP (One-Time Password)** generation and brute-forcing.

**Skills practiced:**
- Understanding how TOTP/HOTP works (Time-based/Counter-based One-Time Passwords)
- Writing scripts to test multiple tokens
- Basic cryptographic manipulation in Python
- Timing attacks and brute-force logic


---

### 🌐 `nginx` Configuration

Worked with `nginx` to:
- Host static content
- Secure endpoints using basic auth
- Set up reverse proxy behavior
- Handle redirection and error pages


---

## 📌 What I Learned

- Linux permissions and file manipulation
- Scripting in Python for automation and offensive tasks
- Basic web security principles
- Brute force and enumeration techniques
- Setting up and hardening web servers

---

## 🧠 Highlights

- Developed tools that simulate real hacking behavior
- Understood how attackers discover vulnerabilities
- Learned by doing — breaking, fixing, and trying again
